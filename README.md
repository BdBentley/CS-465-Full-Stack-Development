# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

## Course Description
Students will design and develop a full stack application through the utilization of programming language frameworks. In creating a full stack application, students will also be responsible for developing a database as well as the code that interfaces their application to the database. This course is the first course in a two-course sequence.

## Further information
In this course we will be developing a web application using different software engineering applications. This course involves using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and NoSQL. During development we will be pushing and pulling our code from github using the command line on our system (powershell for myself). This will show that we are able to fully participate in change management and continous improvement methodologies.

## Architecture

The application that we built used Express, JavaScript, and Single Page Application (known as SPA) in different parts of the development process. These technologies formed the front-end of our application at any one time and were meant to show a sort of progression between how to develop the front-end of an application utilizing different technologies. 

Express is "lighter" than most other frameworks and it requires many boilerplates to get things working. There is no one way of doing things with express and it is easy to create a messy application. Express is great for teams that have set standards with a monorepo, while abstacting our the server config to a library all services can share.

JavaScript is fast, simplistic, and interopable. It is popular and has reduced server load. Javascript has client-side security isses and debugging on the web can be tricky. There can also be browser inconsistency.

SPAs are fast and most resources are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of the application, only data is transmitted. The development is simple and streamlined, and there is no need to write code to render pages on the server. You can start development simply from a file://URI without a server at all before deployment. SPAs are also simple to debug, both in Visual Studio and web browsers that allows you to inspect backend code such as Chrome.

The application used NoSQL MongoDB as a database. NoSQL databases such as MongoDB store their data in documents retrievable as JSON objects rather than tables. NoSQL databases are flexible and provide huge scalability gains.
    
## Functionality

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation, JSON is a text-based data format that is used to store and transfer data. JSON is derived from Javascript, so the syntax resembles JavaScript object syntax. JSON cannot contain functions meanwhile Javascript can contain functions. JSON objects the keys must be a string written with double quotes. Meanwhile in JavaSCript a key can be strings, numbers, or identifier names.  JSON allows objects to be added and removed from the database such as trips and foods. These objects can be created, appended, or removed.

## Testing

Testing was done by running website at first through NPM. We would utilize commands in Windows powershell to start the website server, allowing us to see the recent changes made and reflected on the front-end side. Later we were able to test our database changes by running the application postman which allowed us to check that the back-end logic of the application was properly seeding the database with the correct objects.

## Reflection

This course has taught me a breadth of subjects that I have not yet had exposure to. It allowed me to utilize the previous concepts learned in systems design courses and database development to flesh out this web application. Overall, I would love to continue to develop on this project, as well as take on other web development project.
